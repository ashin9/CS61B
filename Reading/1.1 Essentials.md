## Hello World

syntactic features

- class declaration
- public static void main(String[] args)
- curly braces `{` and `}`
- Statements must end with semi-colons.

### Variables and Loops

Some interesting features

- Our variable x must be declared before it is used, *and it must be given a type!*
- Our loop definition is contained inside of curly braces, and the boolean expression that is tested is contained inside of parentheses.
- Our print statement is just `System.out.print` instead of `System.out.println`. This means we should not include a newline (a return).
- Our print statement adds a number to a space. This makes sure the numbers don't run into each other. Try removing the space to see what happens.
- When we run it, our prompt ends up on the same line as the numbers (which you can fix in the following exercise if you'd like).

**Exercise 1.1.2.** 

cumulative sum of the integers from 0 to 9.

### Static Typing

all variables and expressions have a so-called `static type`

the type of a variable can never change.

Java compiler 关键特性：执行静态类型检查



```java
public class HelloNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < 10) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
            x = x + 1;
        }
        x = "horse";
    }
}

$ javac HelloNumbers.java 
HelloNumbers.java:9: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
        x = "horse";
                ^
1 error
```

能让程序员准确知道类型



To summarize, static typing has the following advantages:

- The compiler ensures that all types are compatible, making it easier for the programmer to debug their code.
- Since the code is guaranteed to be free of type errors, users of your compiled programs will never run into type errors. For example, Android apps are written in Java, and are typically distributed only as .class files, i.e. in a compiled format. As a result, such applications should never crash due to a type error since they have already been checked by the compiler.
- Every variable, parameter, and function has a declared type, making it easier for a programmer to understand and reason about code.

**Extra Thought Exercise**

```java
Py:
print(5 + "horse")
  报错，因为不知道结果是什么类型

String h = 5 + "horse";
int h = 5 + "horse";

System.out.println(5 + "horse");
"5horse"

System.out.println(5 + "10"); print? 510, or 15? 
  "15"
How about System.out.println(5 + 10);?
  15
```

### Defining Functions in Java

Java 代码冗长，短期会减慢速度，把所有想象成不了解的安全设备，但构建大型程序是有利的

### Code Style, Comments, Javadoc

good coding style

- Consistent style (spacing, variable naming, brace style, etc)
- Size (lines that are not too wide, source files that are not too long)
- Descriptive naming (variables, functions, classes), e.g. variables or functions with names like `year` or `getUserName` instead of `x` or `f`.
- Avoidance of repetitive code: You should almost never have two significant blocks of code that are nearly identical except for a few changes.
- Comments where appropriate. Line comments in Java use the `//` delimiter. Block (a.k.a. multi-line comments) comments use `/*` and `*/`.

The golden rule is this: Write your code so that it is easy for a stranger to understand.

#### Comments

comment using the so-called [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) format.

used [javadoc tool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html) can be used to generate HTML descriptions of your code.
